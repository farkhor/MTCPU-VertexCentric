## MTCPU-VertexCentric ##
This repository contains a multi-threaded implementation of vertex-centric graph processing for CPUs written with C++11. The graph representation, the vertex and the edge structures, and processing functions are similar to vertex-centric CSR graph processing in [CuSha](http://farkhor.github.io/CuSha/).
